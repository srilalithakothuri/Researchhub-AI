## ✨ Core Ecosystem

### 🎙️ AI Chat: Your Research Partner
Engage with a context-aware AI capable of deep technical analysis.
- **Voice-to-Text**: Hands-free research! Click the pulsing mic and narrate your thoughts.
- **Multiple Sessions**: Organize different research tracks into separate chat threads.
- **Intelligent Search**: Instantly find that specific insight across your entire conversation history.
- **Auto-Summarization**: The AI automatically titles your chats based on context.

### 📚 My Library: The Paper Intelligence Hub
Transform a static collection of PDFs into an interactive knowledge base.
- **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple research papers at once.
- **Automated Synthesis**: Select multiple papers to generate a single **Executive Report**, synthesizing findings across different studies.
- **Metadata Extraction**: AI automatically identifies titles, authors, and generates concise summaries.
- **Semantic indexing**: (RAG-ready) Papers are processed for deep retrieval and cross-referencing.

### 📝 DocSpace: Structured Insight Capture
A dedicated space for drafting and organizing your research notes.
- **Project Hierarchy**: Group related findings into projects.
- **Clean Editor**: Focus-mode writing environment for capturing complex ideas.
- **Note Management**: Track word counts, edit titles, and organize sub-notes with a sleek, folder-based UI.

### 📅 Smart Task Scheduler
Maintain research momentum with a built-in productivity engine.
- **Priority Modeling**: Color-coded tasks (Low, Mid, High) for better focus.
- **Interactive Tracking**: Seamlessly update status and track deadlines.
- **Productivity Analytics**: Visualize your completion rates and consistency over time.

### 📊 Research Analytics (The "Analytics" Engine)
Know exactly where you stand with your research goals.
- **Metric Dashboard**: Real-time tracking of total papers, AI interactions, and tasks.
- **Weekly Heatmaps**: Visualize your research activity patterns.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Get personalized recommendations based on your recent activity trends.

## 🎨 Premium Design & UX
- **Glassmorphism Aesthetics**: A deep-space theme with violet accents, blur effects, and smooth gradients.
- **Micro-Animations**: Framer Motion powered transitions that make the interface feel alive.
- **Responsive Mastery**: A fully collapsible sidebar and fluid layouts optimized for both ultra-wide monitors and mobile devices.
- **PK Branding**: Minimalist, professional logo and identity throughout the application.

---

## 🛠️ Performance Architecture
- **Groq Llama 3.3 70B**: Sub-second AI inference speeds.
- **JWT Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication.
